# KEA Technical Interview

## Overview

For candidates applying for a developer position at KEA, this is my solution at test.

## Solution

The final list of taxpayer with the best chance of being contacted with fewer calls consists of the 8 customers with the top scores and 2 randomly selected from those considered to have low data. The selection of these additional customers is based on their historical behavior in terms of offer acceptance, offer cancellation, and average response time.

## Normalized assumptions
- accepted_offers >= 0.4
- canceled_offers <= 0.6
- averange_reply_time <= 0.5
